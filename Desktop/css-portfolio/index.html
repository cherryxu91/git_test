        <h2>Clinical Dietitian</h2>

        <p>I have been a dietitian for the last 6 years in both community and
          clinical settings, and I have been contemplating on a career change for
          the past couple of years. I dabbled in some Python last summer and
          decided to also learn some HTML/CSS. I am in the process of becoming
          a frontend developer and would like to keep learning! </p>
        <p>I enjoy working with people and helping others achieve their goals.
         While learning, I will also try to help others along the way if I can.</p>
